# How To - Construct a component

## Rules

### Module

-   Use **ES6** and `import`/`export` syntax.
-   All exports must be named (**no** default !).
-   Components are to be written as functions.
-   One component per module is the default.

### Package

You will need to find a package to host your new component.
Then you can create two files a js and a css with the name of your component.
And export/import it from the indexes of that package.

### Composition

Using the `children` property is the idiomatic way to do composition.
Often child use the same pattern, for example displaying an icon next to a label.
In this case, we provide explicit properties to simplify implementation.
For example, Display takes an `icon` property in addition to `children`;
this way the icon is placed properly depending on the type of Display.

When composing children you can helper to following util functions :

-   wrapLabel: will wrap labels in a span if needed, useful for spacing & :last-child pseudo-selectors.
-   alterElement: complex overrides of childs (special consideration for classNames).

### Props

-   All props must be spread from the component function declaration.
-   Props given to a component which are not explicitly documentend, are spread back to the root element using `...otherProps`.
-   Default props are to be defined using es6 default syntax (rather than component's defaultProps); eg: `function Input({ disabled = false }) { ... }`.
-   Props **must** ordered alphabetically.

üì£ **Note:** For complex default properties, eg: `array`, `function` or `object`. It must declared next to the component.
Otherwise it will be seen as a new prop value at each render.

```diff
- function Input({ timeout = { easing: 0, duration: 100 } })
+ const defaultTimeout = { easing: 0, duration: 100 };
+ function Input({ timeout = defaultTimeout })
```

üì£ **Note:** As you give otherProps to the root element of you component.
You should consider using the util method `filterProps` as it will make sure that you don't give unknown html attributes to your DOM elements.

### CSS Selector construction

-   BIO (BEM + ITCSS + OOCSS) as CSS convention (https://css-tricks.com/combining-the-powers-of-sem-and-bio-for-improving-css/).
-   `className` is given to the root node.
-   When CSS is conditional use the classnames library to help you build the class.
-   If you need to customize a nested component style, you have to give it an additional className.
    eg: `thc-c-list__dropdown` for a Dropdown component nested in a List component.

Complex example:

```jsx
function List({ className, condensed = false, dropdownClassName: dropdownClassNameProp }) {
    const rootClassName = clasnames("thc-c-list", { "thc-c-list--condensed": condensed });
    const dropdownClassName = clasnames("thc-c-list__dropdown", dropdownClassNameProp);

    return (
        <div className={rootClassName}>
            <Dropdown className={dropdownClassName} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

üì£ **Note:** Be carreful with the order you write the selectors depending on the priority. You need to help yourself using ITCSS & OOCSS rules for that.

### CSS Definition

In your CSS file associated to your component. You will need to scope your CSS variables with the following manner :

1. `:root`: every CSS variable that isn't aware of theme (ie. not colors)
2. `thc-theme--XXX`: every CSS variable that is aware of theme (ie. colors)
3. `thc-c-component`: specificities to your components and variable override selections

```css
:root {
    /* Spacing is always the same  */
    --thc-card-border: var(--thc-borderSolid--S);
}

.thc-theme--light {
    /* Color depends on the theme and can change depending on the component's state */
    --thc-card-background-color: var(--thc-color--white-100);
    --thc-card-background-color--hover: var(--thc-color--white-80);
}

.thc-theme--dark {
    /* Same description but for dark theme */
    --thc-card-background-color: var(--thc-color--black-100);
    --thc-card-background-color--hover: var(--thc-color--black-80);
}

.thc-c-card {
    /* Apply CSS variables */
    border: var(--thc-card-border);
    /* Apply the generic variant of the background variable */
    background-color: var(--thc-card-background-color);
}

.thc-c-card:hover {
    /* Override the generic --thc-card-background-color */
    --thc-card-background-color: var(--thc-card-background-color--hover);
}
```

üì£ **Note:** In the hover case you need to overide the generic variant and not the background property directly.
That is important to maintain one place where the CSS attributes are writen (the main class selector) and is more
easy to customize where needed (due to CSS selectors priority).

### CSS Rules

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** A component can never ever never space itself using margin as a default (but it can use padding internally).
The goal is to make sure that a component can be used at diferrent places without needding overrides. If a spacing pattern
is common, you can add a container for that component and it the container that will space components between one another.
The same rule will apply to the container it cannot sapce itself by default from other stuff.

```css
:root {
    --thc-component-spacing: var(--thc-spacing--XL);
}

.thc-c-component-container .thc-c-component + .thc-c-component-container .thc-c-component {
    margin-top: var(--thc-component-spacing);
}
```

### Nested components

Nested components inside a component have:

-   Their own flattened properties when these are key to the top level component abstraction, for instance an `id` prop for the Input component.
-   Their own `xxxProps` property for when developers need to tweak the nested component's props.
-   Their own `xxxClassName` property for when developper need to add a className to the nested component.
-   Sometimes their own `XxxComponent` property for performing component injection (mind the Pascal naming).
-   Their own `xxxRef` property when you might need to perform imperative actions.

### Property naming

The name of a boolean property should be chossen based on the **default value**. For example, the `disabled` attribute on an input element,
if supplied, defaults to `true`. This allows the shorthand notation:

```diff
- <Input enabled={false} />
+ <Input disabled />
```

If you need to manipulate the value of a property inside a component,
you need to rename it during the spread with a `Prop` suffix (its name will be available inside the component).
Eg: `value` -> `valueProp`.
This way it is explicit from the component signature that the value might change in the component.

```jsx
function Input({ disabled = false, value: valueProp }) {
    const value = !disabled && value;

    return <input value={value} />;
}
```

### Events

When manipulating event handlers inside a component, if the event is named `onChange`, your handler will be named `handleChange`.
This way in your custom handler you will be able to reference a potential `onChange` property given to your component.

Utils function exists to help you manipulate events:

-   wrapEvent: helper to handle easily preventDefault & disabled with events.
-   wrapKeyUp: compose an event to be keyboard compatible for SPACE and ENTER keys.

Moreover, accessibility rules dictate to add a role attribute and support keyboard to DOM elements having click capabilities (more on a11y documentation).

```jsx
function Input({ disabled = false, onChange }) {
    const handleChange = wrapPrevent((event) => {
        // Do your logic here

        if (onChange) {
            onChange(event);
        }
    }, diabled);

    const handleKeyUp = wrapKeyUp(handleChange);

    return <input onChange={handleChange} onKeyUp={handleKeyUp} />;
}
```

### Inputs

Special consideration must be given to the care of inputs.

The change events for inputs needs to be compliant with Formik API.
To accomplish that goal the helper method `patchFormEventValue` has been written.
Its goal is to help you respect the minimum required attributes on your event Formik.

```js
export function patchFormEventValue(originalEvent, newTarget, newValue);
```

-   originalEvent: Original SyntheticEvent -> triggering event.
-   newTarget: New target -> your input DOM component.
-   newValue: New value -> override the value.

A HOC component exist to transform your input components into fields :

-   fieldHoc: hoc to transform an input into a field.

It will take care of extracting logic for errors, labels, helpers etc. and give the rest to your input.

### Customization: boolean vs enum

There are two options to design the variations of a component: with a _boolean\*_ or with an _enum\*_.
For example, let's take a button that has different types. Each option has its pros and cons:

-   Option 1 _boolean_:

```ts
type Props = {
    contained: boolean;
    fab: boolean;
};
```

This API enabled te shorthand notation: `<Button />`, `<Button contained />` or `<Button fab/>`.

-   Otions 2 _enum_:

```ts
type Props = {
    variant: "text" | "contained" | "fab";
};
```

This API is more verbose: `<Button />` ("text" is the default), `<Button variant="condensed />` or `<Button variant="fab" />`.

However it prevents an invalid combination from being used, bounds the number of properties exposed, and can easily support new values in the future.

üì£ **Note:** The design-system components use a combination of the two approaches according to the following rules:

-   A boolean is used when **2** possible values are required, or if the variation is compatible with several other variants; eg: `condensed`.
-   An enum is used when **> 2** possible values are required, or if there is the possibility that additional possible values may be required in the future.

### Ref

The `ref` is forwarded to the root element. This means that, without changing the rendered root element via the `component` prop,
it is forwarded to the outermost DOM element which the component renders. If you pass a different component via the `component` prop,
the ref will be attached to that component instead.

## Base template

```jsx
// Libs
import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import classnames from "classnames";

export function Component({ className }) {
    const rootClassName = classnames("thc-c-component", className);

    return <div className={rootClassName}></div>;
}

Component.propTypes = {
    /**
     * Additional className
     */
    className: PropTypes.string,
};
```

```css
:root {
    --thc-component-xxx: xxx;
}

.thc-theme--light {
    --thc-component-yyy: xxx;
}

.thc-theme--dark {
    --thc-component-yyy: xxx;
}

.thc-c-component {
    xxx: var(--thc-component-xxx)
    yyy: var(--thc-component-yyy)
}
```
